# 📌 Final Case Finance Project
## 🚀This application is a platform designed to simplify financial management and help users track their expenses across various categories. The application consists of 9 different forms: Signup, Login, Banks, Dashboard, BankTransactions, Categories, Billing, Expenses, and Settings. Each form is designed to enhance user experience and improve efficiency.

**🖥️Signup:**  *Users can register for a new account. If an email address or username already exists,
 the message "This username or email is already in use" will appear. If any field is left empty, the message "Please fill in all fields" will be shown. If the user already has an account, they can directly proceed to the login screen.*

**🔑Login:** *To log in, users must enter their email and password. If an invalid email format is entered, the message "Invalid email format" will appear.
If the fields are left empty, the message "Please enter email and password" will be displayed. After successful login, users gain access to the main features of the application.*

**📊Dashboard:** *Users can view their total balance, invoice titles, and the latest incoming transfers on this screen. The application also displays paid invoices periodically, using a timer to show them in a loop.*

**📝BankTransactions:** *This form displays the last 10 bank transactions. If fewer than 10 transactions exist, the empty fields will show "no data found" to prevent errors.*

**🛒Categories:** *This screen shows how much money has been spent in each category, with dynamic text displaying this information in a loop using a timer.*

**🏠Billing:** *Users can view their paid invoices, add new invoices, remove existing ones, and update details on this screen.*
